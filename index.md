<p style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; margin: 0;">
I am a senior at UMass Amherst studying Computer Science and Computational Linguistics. My research focus is mechanistic interpretability, specifically examining the intersection of NLP and linguistic phenomena. I am currently conducting a senior thesis on morphological tokenization advised by Katrin Erk, as well as doing interperetability research in the detection of "translationese" with Shira Wein.

I also have experience in broader machine learning, as well as software engineering and applied LLMs. Outside of academia, my main interest is in the climate technology space.

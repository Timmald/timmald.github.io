## Projects
I get curious about a lot of random stuff and try to make it a reality. Here is a (very non-exhaustive) list of curiosities I have followed:

- GRPO Experimentation

  Experimented with Group-Relative Policy Optimizaiton (GRPO) for various LLM fine-tuning tasks. Attempted to create a reward function to measure the "rhymingness" of 2 lines of verse, in order to fine-tune a poetry LLM with RL. Also created a custom reward function to incentivize use of more frequent words, in attempt to fine-tune LLM to speak only in the most common english words

- Script Generation

  Built a custom corpus of video scripts, and fine-tuned an LLM using SFT to generate original video scripts.


- Unnatural Language Processing

  Trained RNN-based model to predict phonemes from english text, and built a web application around it to make a text-to-speech site.

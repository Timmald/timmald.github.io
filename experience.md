*Summers 2024, 2025*

Investigated the ways LLMs could be use for real-world business cases at TechWorks, including querying databases with natural language, complex document evaluation, and how/when to fine-tune LLMs for the best results and lowest cost. Also assisted with software engineering tasks, including participating in 2 weeklong TechWorks hackathons, and refactored a suite of old web/mobile applications totalling 100,000 lines of code.
